# Courtyard

## What is this project?
This project contains implementations of content creator Couriway's custom bastion, for Minecraft java 1.16.1

## Downloads and Installation: 
There are 4 separate downloads, each of which contains a slightly different implementation. The .jar files are installed as fabric mods, which only need a 1.16.1 installation of fabric, while the .zip files can be used as datapacks. The extra characters are simply for formatting during installation.

The s and a versions of the datapack distinguish between replacing only stables bastions or replacing all bastions.
